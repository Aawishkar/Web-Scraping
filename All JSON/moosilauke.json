In the age of specialization, we pride ourselves on being a camp that has eight land sport options including lacrosse, and baseball on two minor league quality diamonds, a full waterfront where campers can do everything from sailing to canoeing to wake surfing, while also offering an array of outdoor adventure experiences that includes multiple night backpacking experiences and white water kayaking and canoe trips. In over 117 years, no camper has come to camp experienced and confident in all our activity areas so every camper will have areas where they will be taking risks and encountering and overcoming failure.",

Additionally, there are free-choice days throughout the summer. Evenings are usually reserved for special activities like fishing, waterskiing, tubing and team-building games.",
