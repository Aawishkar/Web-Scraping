            "Timber Lake Camp sits on a mountaintop surrounded by 500 acres in New York\u2019s Catskill Mountains, just 2.5 hours from New York City. A traditional, co-ed camp, we feature two private, spring-fed lakes and an outstanding array of facilities on magnificently manicured grounds.",
            "At Timber Lake, we foster values of sharing, integrity, responsibility and respect in a friendly, safe environment of fun. The best camp experience gives children greater self-confidence and self-esteem. They learn to value others by being valued themselves. And they leave camp with memories that will last a lifetime. This is what we have been doing successfully for more than six decades.",

Our athletic program features top-quality instruction by experienced varsity & college coaches on outstanding facilities. The right balance between competition and having fun allows every camper to be comfortable joining in, while promoting teamwork and spirit. Winning is great, but our goal is that every camper walks off the field or court with more friends, more confidence, and higher self-esteem. Campers hone their skills through athletic instruction and clinics in a wide variety of sports \u2013 basketball, roller-hockey, baseball, softball, soccer, flag football, tennis, golf and lacrosse. Our elective periods allow your child to focus on their favorite sports with additional, advanced instruction and are also an opportunity to try something new. Not only do campers compete against each other, TLC participates in many different inter-camp tournaments for all ages. Some of the competitions we host include theJacobs Cup Basketball, theGordon Cup Roller Hockey, theMelter Cup Girls Softballand the Owner\u2019s Cup Baseball tournaments.",

A variety of theme days & activities ranging from our Olympics to our Jacobs Cup Basketball Tournament make Wednesdays special with everyone getting swept up in camp spirit! Camp doesn\u2019t slow down when the sun goes down. Whether it\u2019s a Saturday night theater production, a fun Friday night Social, outdoor games & contests or a late-night league game on one of our many lighted courts, evening activities are among the best times of the day at Timber Lake. Before bedtime, a stop with friends at the Canteen to grab a snack, hangout, play table tennis and billiards ends the day on the right note. Marathon, our version of Color War, is the perfect way to close out a great summer with 4 to 5 days of fun and intense competition. The camp is divided into two teams (Green & White) that compete in a variety of activities ranging from athletics, to the arts and favorites like the Apache Relay, and Rope Burn \u2013 which all culminates in Sing Night where the two teams perform their dances, skits & sing their alma maters.",

Our Leadership Training Program (LTP) is designed for our 2nd Year Teens who are looking to come back to camp as Junior Counselors the following summer. Teens help out in various roles \u2013 coaching and refereeing lower camp\u2019s athletic leagues, participating in our Big Brother/Big Sister program, while also giving a hand in the bunks. These positions help get them ready for the following summer and allow them to give back to the place they\u2019ve called their summer home for so many years.",
