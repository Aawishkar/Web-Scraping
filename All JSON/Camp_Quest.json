We introduce campers to these freethought heroes in our Famous Freethinkers program. Campers learn about the lives of these famous individuals, from Susan B. Anthony and Charles Darwin to Meryl Streep and Daniel Radcliffe. Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint which holds that positions regarding truth should be formed on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma. Campers learn that freethinkers are a diverse group, including people of different ages, genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, as well as people from various historical time periods, occupations, economic backgrounds, nationalities, and cultures.",

Motivated by the loftiest of prizes, a pre-1954 one-hundred-dollar bill, campers have vied to do the impossible: prove that the unicorns do not exist. As Camp Quest has matured and expanded, new mythical creatures have become part of Camp Quest lore. Our Invisible Creatures activity is an enormously fun and spirited way to build camp identity and explore complex philosophical problems. Invisible Creatures also introduces campers to logical fallacies and complements our other critical thinking and reasoning activities.",

Camp Quest aims to expose young people to the various, complex ideas that exist in the world, not to dictate how they will accept or reject those ideas. Teaching our campers to respect and learn about other peoples beliefs and cultures allows them to model for others the same respect and empathy we desire for ourselves.",
