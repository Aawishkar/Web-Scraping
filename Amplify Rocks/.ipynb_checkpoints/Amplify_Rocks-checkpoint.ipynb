The Legends camp out takes place at a local beach campground in Ventura where campers grades 9-12 enjoy campfire cooked meals, s’mores, late night music, and bonding around the fire before being lulled to sleep by nature’s original noise machine, the ocean. LITs rite of passage journey takes place on an overnight camping trip full of adventure. Intersession trips change each year. Pervious years activities included ziplining through the mountains of Catalina Island, rafting the Kern River, and stay and play weekends where we plan super fun off campus trips but sleep on campus. Campers get to vote on what weekend extravaganza we go on during the application process. All summer long, we’re kickin’ it at the beach, hitting up our local escape rooms and roller rinks, kayaking, rock climbing, and so much more. Plus there’s our world-famous FIELD DAY, a “free choice” day of special electives, shuttles into town or the beach, pool games, movie marathons, trying to tag Gracie in laser tag, karaoke, root beer floats, and so much more! There are always lots of things to choose from to make sure kids always have options that they enjoy.',\n",
